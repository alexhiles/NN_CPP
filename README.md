# Artificial Neural Networks in C++
General artificial neural network implemented in C++.

Currently implemented:
- Naive Implementation based on work in the [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1165748).

Compiling from MAC OS X:

```C++
 g++ -std=c++xx main.cpp -o main
 ./main
```

Replace 'xx' with the C++ version you have installed. Current implementation works with 11, 14 and 17.  

## To Do

- Add arbitrary layers and neurons to implementation
